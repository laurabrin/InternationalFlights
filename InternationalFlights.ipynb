When domestic flight centers experience multiple delays, air traffic decision makers can use the model to help predict which flights should be prioritized for take-off to reduce flight delay propagation into international connecting flights. It will do this by looking at the relationship between the flight's intended landing airport, the number of international airports that site connects with, how many flights leave that site, the region of the airport and the time of year."
